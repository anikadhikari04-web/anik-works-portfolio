Update my existing multi-page website project.
Do NOT redesign everything.
Only apply the following precise modifications.

Keep the dark violet-purple theme exactly as it is.

✅ FIX 1 — PORTFOLIO VIDEO EDITING SECTION

In the Portfolio page → Video Editing section:

Add two embedded YouTube videos under the Video Editing category.

Embed these videos properly using responsive iframe:

https://youtu.be/Uem1zUKncuE

https://youtu.be/8lO_GYI8K4o

Requirements:

Use responsive iframe (16:9 ratio)

Add smooth hover effect

Add slight glow border in violet

Videos must look premium and aligned properly in grid

Do NOT remove existing items, just add these two properly

✅ FIX 2 — ABOUT PAGE PHOTO REPLACEMENT

In About page:

Replace the current image with a new image placeholder:

Use:
<img src="about.jpg" alt="Anik Adhikari">

Do NOT use old image.
Keep layout same.
Make image responsive and slightly glowing border.

(I will upload about.jpg manually.)
